# Terraform — Infrastructure as Code Writer

Writes Terraform code following strict module abstraction, file structure, and quality standards. Every module must represent a meaningful level of abstraction, use the latest stable releases, and pass format/init/validate before any commit.

## Input Format

```
/terraform <task description>
```

- Describe the infrastructure to create, modify, or refactor
- Include the target provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) if known
- Include any specific constraints or existing module paths if relevant

## Core Principles

### Module Abstraction

Modules must represent **meaningful levels of abstraction** — never thin wrappers around a single resource. A module's value is in encoding an opinionated, complete infrastructure pattern that a caller treats as a single concept.

**Wrong:** A module that only wraps `aws_s3_bucket` and passes through a handful of arguments.

**Right:** A module that creates a bucket with server-side encryption, versioning, lifecycle rules, and optional replication — a complete, reusable pattern with sensible defaults.

Every module must have **low complexity at its own level**. If `main.tf` is growing hard to scan, delegate that complexity to sub-modules or shared modules. Each level should be easy to comprehend on its own without tracing through many moving parts.

### Module Hierarchy

Terraform modules form a hierarchy. Each level has a defined responsibility:

| Level | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Root module** | Wires type modules together. Contains only `module` blocks and `locals`. No resource blocks. |
| **Type modules** | Implement one infrastructure concern at a moderate abstraction level. `main.tf` should be readily understandable at a glance. |
| **Sub-modules / shared modules** | Handle specific reusable patterns delegated from type modules. Still not thin resource wrappers. |

The rule: if reading `main.tf` at any level requires tracking many moving parts to understand what it does, that level has too much complexity. Extract a sub-module.

### File Structure

Every module uses this structure:

```
module-name/
├── main.tf        # Resource definitions and module calls
├── variables.tf   # Input variable declarations with descriptions and types
├── outputs.tf     # Output value declarations with descriptions
└── versions.tf    # terraform block with required_version and required_providers
```

Add files beyond this set only when a distinct logical concern warrants separation:
- `locals.tf` — when local value expressions are extensive
- `data.tf` — when many data source lookups would clutter `main.tf`

**File naming rules (strictly enforced):**
- Never prefix files numerically (`01-network.tf`, `02-compute.tf` — forbidden)
- Never name files after infrastructure types (`ec2.tf`, `rds.tf`, `vpc.tf`, `iam.tf` — forbidden)
- File names describe logical role in the module, not the resource types inside them

---

## Step 1: Look Up Versions Before Writing Any Code

Always use the **latest stable release** of Terraform and every provider. Never pin to an old version unless the user explicitly requires it.

Before writing any `.tf` file, fetch current versions:

1. Check the latest Terraform release at https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases — use the highest non-prerelease version tag.
2. Check each required provider in the Terraform Registry at https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers — navigate to the provider, confirm the latest published version.
3. Write `versions.tf` with those versions before writing any other file.

**`versions.tf` template:**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = "~> <latest_major.minor>"

  required_providers {
    <provider> = {
      source  = "<namespace>/<provider>"
      version = "~> <latest_major>"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `~>` (pessimistic constraint operator) to allow patch updates within the pinned minor version for `required_version`, and patch/minor updates within the pinned major version for providers.

---

## Step 2: Look Up Provider Documentation Before Writing Resources

Never write resource blocks or data source blocks from memory. Provider schemas change between versions — arguments are added, renamed, or deprecated.

For every resource or data source you write:

1. Navigate to the provider's documentation page in the Terraform Registry: `https://registry.terraform.io/providers/<namespace>/<provider>/latest/docs/resources/<resource_type>`
2. Verify the current argument names, required vs. optional fields, and any deprecation notices.
3. Copy argument names exactly as documented — do not guess or abbreviate.

If the registry page for a resource is unavailable, use the provider's GitHub repository under `website/docs/r/`.

---

## Step 3: Write the Module

Apply these rules as you write each file:

### `main.tf`

- Contains resource blocks and calls to sub-modules only
- No variable declarations, no output declarations, no provider configuration
- Should be readable top-to-bottom without needing to cross-reference other files constantly
- If it exceeds ~80 lines and is difficult to scan, delegate blocks to a sub-module

### `variables.tf`

- Every variable must have a `description`
- Every variable must have an explicit `type`
- Provide `default` values only where a sensible, safe default exists
- Use `validation` blocks for values with known constraints (e.g., allowed regions, name length limits)

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Deployment environment name (e.g. production, staging)."
  type        = string

  validation {
    condition     = contains(["production", "staging", "development"], var.environment)
    error_message = "environment must be one of: production, staging, development."
  }
}
```

### `outputs.tf`

- Every output must have a `description`
- Export values that callers will need to wire modules together or reference externally
- Do not export internal implementation details that no caller would use

### Sub-modules

Create a sub-module when:
- A logical group of resources within a type module makes `main.tf` hard to scan
- The same pattern is needed in more than one place

Place sub-modules in a `modules/` directory within the parent module:

```
type-module/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── versions.tf
└── modules/
    └── sub-concern/
        ├── main.tf
        ├── variables.tf
        └── outputs.tf
```

---

## Step 4: Pre-Commit Workflow

Run these three commands in order inside **every module directory that was created or modified**. Do not commit until all three pass cleanly.

### 4a — Format

```bash
terraform fmt -recursive
```

Apply all reported formatting changes. Re-run until the command exits with no output (no changes needed).

### 4b — Init (no backend)

```bash
terraform init -backend=false
```

Downloads providers and validates the `required_providers` block without configuring a remote backend. Required before validate can run.

If init fails due to a version constraint conflict, re-check the registry for current versions and update `versions.tf`.

### 4c — Validate

```bash
terraform validate
```

All modules must pass with `Success! The configuration is valid.` — no errors, no warnings. Fix every issue before committing.

### 4d — Commit

Only after all three commands pass cleanly across every modified module directory.

## Module Abstraction Checklist

Work through this before considering any module done:

- [ ] Does the module represent a meaningful abstraction, not a thin resource wrapper?
- [ ] Can you read `main.tf` top-to-bottom and understand what it does without deep investigation?
- [ ] Are all files named without numeric prefixes or infrastructure-type names?
- [ ] Is `versions.tf` present with the latest stable versions looked up from the registry?
- [ ] Did you fetch and verify provider docs for every resource and data source written?
- [ ] Are all variables typed and described?
- [ ] Are all outputs described?
- [ ] Does complex logic inside this module delegate to a sub-module rather than bloating `main.tf`?
- [ ] Have `fmt`, `init -backend=false`, and `validate` all passed cleanly?

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **`terraform fmt` reports changes** | Apply changes, re-run until no output |
| **`terraform init` fails on version constraint** | Re-fetch current versions from registry, update `versions.tf`, retry |
| **`terraform validate` fails** | Fix all errors; never suppress with `ignore_changes` or workarounds unless the resource genuinely requires it |
| **Resource argument unknown or deprecated** | Fetch current provider docs from registry; update to the current schema |
| **`main.tf` exceeds ~80 lines and is hard to scan** | Extract a sub-module; do not keep complexity at the current level |
| **Same pattern used in multiple places** | Extract a shared module; do not duplicate resource blocks |
| **Registry documentation is unavailable** | Use the provider's GitHub `website/docs/r/` directory as fallback |
